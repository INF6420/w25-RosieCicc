            <h1 id="blog-post">Why did you start the blog?</h1>
            <p>This is a just a fun experience for getting into web development. And I love my cat. I wanted my website to be reminiscent of old internet blogs in the 2000's to 2010's. Not as flashy of course, but I really love how people would make websites for just about anything.</p>

            <h1 id="blog-post">Why do you care about cats?</h1>
            <p>I have always grown up with cats. I have had dogs too, but I cats have always left more of an impact on my life. I also find they get a lot of unnesscessary hate and I would like to stop it.</p>

            <h1 id="blog-post">More about me!</h1>
            <p>I have always lived in the south-east part of Michigan, but I am planning on one day moving down south. I can not stand the cold! Right now I am taking a MLIS program through WSU and am really enjoying it so far. Outside of the student life, I work at a before/after school program where I work with 5-10 year old children, it's just to make money but I do really enjoy it. As for hobbies I love video games, drawing, and going down rabbit holes online.</p>
