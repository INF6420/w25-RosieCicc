            <h2>Why you should own a cat! </h2>
            <h5>March 2025</h5>
        <p> I am not trying to say that everyone on planet Earth should own a cat, this one just goes out to the people who have entertained the idea of owning cat. Or maybe to people who think that they don't like animals. Or even maybe to people who don't like cats. Anyways, on to the actual post! Just to get this out of the way if you are allergic to cats, check out cat breeds like Russian Blues, Siberians, or Sphynxes because they are hypoallergenic among 10 other breeds of cats! Ok, I love cats and what they have to offer. If you like the idea of a pet that likes you, but also wants their alone time; a cat is a great option! If you don't have the time or space to take an animal outside, a cat is a great choice! There is the popular assumption that cats are divas and yes they can be, but that does not mean they don't like spending time with you. My cat, Jojo, loves her alone time and can be very bossy, but whenever I have company over or my mom and I are chatting, Jojo will just sit next to us like she wants to be part of the conversation. On another note, I often hear of another assumption that cats are mean. Now if the cat's ears are flattened back, then yes it's probably mad at you for something. But if the cat's ears are forward facing and up, then it's most likely the cat just wants to play. If this has convinced you in anyway to try owning a cat, wonderful, but please do your research! I can see making another post about this in the future, but please look at different breeds of cats and your availability. Just because you don't have to take a cat on walks does not mean they'll like it when you're not at home for 12+ hours. Thanks for reading and see you next week!</p>

            <h2>Keep your cats indoors! Here's why... </h2>
            <h5>March 2025</h5>
        <p> I was raised thinking it was ok to let our cats outside. Not on a leash or in a fenced area; just allowing them to roam around the neighborhood was perfectly okay. My cats would always make it back inside each night, come home with "gifts" for us, and never got hurt or sick from being outside. I realize now how lucky my cats were. Pet cats are in danger of being hit by cars, being attacked, or contract worms or even rabies. There is also the danger that cats bring to the outdoors. A study done by the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources of The University of Georgia, found that of the 39 prey animals that were killed by cats only half of them were eaten. The other half were either brought home as "gifts" or left on the ground. Outdoor cats have also made a huge impact on the bird population over the years with cats killing 2.4 billion birds every year.</p>
        
        <p> I know you may think your cat is the sweetest little guy and you feed them so well at home, but your little guy is still a predator. There are many ways to entertain your cat(s) at home, I know mine loves a good cardboard box. I know this topic is controversial with many of us growing up thinking outdoors cats are perfectly fine, but please think about your local wildlife and your cat's health. You have no idea how much of impact it is to keep your cat inside. If you would like to learn more I will list my sources down below, but I also have a section in my Contact page to help you learn more.</p>

            <h2>Cats and teaching respect.</h2>
            <h5>April 2025</h5>
            <p> We all know that no means no, but sometimes I wish I had claws to really tell someone it's time to back off. Luckily for cats, they do! But claws are not the only ways cats show that they are irritated. Just like every animal, including humans, there are physical signs you can watch out for to see if you cat is irritated or not. When I see my cat start to quickly swish her tail and her eyes get really big, that's when I know she's irritated with me and my petting. More common signs of irritation are flat ears, fully facing the irritant, and yowling or growling. If you notice these signs but are going to continue with the head pats and pets then get ready for some action. Cats will bite, scratch, claw, swipe, or my cat's personal fav, grab your hand, hold it against herself, and kick at it with her claws. Ouch! </p>
